      <h3>Story Ending Two</h3>
      <p>My brother, Kyle, came back home to visit our family. He always comes back every couple of months to visit his friends and our family. He will bring back stories to tell
        of working at Tesla or whatever weird thing he saw in Reno's Costco. Kyle always will rant at the dinner table or whenever he pleases. At least when he rants you always
        learn something.

        One time Kyle ranted about how horrible he though Great Britain was for 15 minutes straight, he didn't even stop to take a breath. He's the most opinionated person I know
        and I admire that.

      <h3>Story Ending Two</h3>
      <p>My brother, Kyle, came back to visit us in Palm Springs, California. It's nice to have the whole family back together and on vacation. We always make mom take us
        to the oasis for an afternoon hike. Later we'll go to whichever restaurant Mom or Kyle wants for dinner and then hopefully travel to the streetfair if it's a Thursday
        night.

        Kyle always wants to do something or go on an adventure when we're there. I'm happy for that since this is how we coerce Mom and Shane, my other brother, into
        going somewhere.
