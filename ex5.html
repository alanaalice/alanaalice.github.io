<h2 style="color:red; font-family:Lobster;">History</h2>
<p style="color:black; font-family:Lobster;">The Lobster font took a different approach. The new OpenType format gives us the possibility to have multiple versions of each letter, and that's exactly what we are doing: Instead of compromising the design of our letters to force connections, we do what lettering artist do. We draw many versions of each letter and a lot of different letter-pairs (aka "ligatures") so we always use the best possible variation of each letter depending of the context of the letter inside each word. All this happens automatically in any browser that supports ligatures.</p>
<h2 style="color:red; font-family:Lobster;">About</h2>
<p style="color:black; font-family:Lobster;">The font was designed for retro designs, elegant, and corporate websites. Lobster is mainly used on billboards, packaging, flyers, and logos.
Lobster is known as the new Comic Sans. It was created in 2010 and introduced to the google font library. The font looks pretty regardless if you're a designer or not. This was intended by the designer of the font.
Lobster is being abused and overused similar to Comic Sans.</p>

<h2 style="color:red; font-family:Lobster;">Opinions</h2>
<p style="color:black; font-family:Lobster;">When first viewing this typeface we realized it is very eye-catching, which is causing it to be overused. People are starting to use this font to much and sometimes using it poorly, making the design look bad. The font's personality is friendly and is a hand-written font. The font is supposed to be elegant and lovely. It's a retro and vintage looking font.</p>
