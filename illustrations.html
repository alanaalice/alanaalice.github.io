    <h2>flower still life</h2>
    <img src="flowerstilllife.jpg" alt="flower still life">
    <p>I created this picture for a design class with the criteria of including both a vase and a bouquet of flowers. I placed
      real estate magazines to further show the perspective of the room while adding detail. I also chose a faceted vase to show
      the fragmented lighting. I struggled with constrast between different areas of light and dark. I fixed this by layering graphite
      until I achieve the desired darkness of the area.
    <p>Done in graphite.</p>

    <h2>skeleton</h2>
    <img src="skeletondes14.jpg" alt="skeleton">
    <p>This image is based upon a skeleton study of another artist. I chose the backside of the skeleton to show the different geometric
      shapes within the set of bones. For shading, I only used stippling. It was difficult to distinguish certain areas of the skeleton that had
      similar areas of light and dark. To provide further constrast, I outlined the different bones within the skeleton.</p>
    <p>Done in pen and ink.</p>
