      <p>This is my class portal page for submitting various exercises and projects. The page was originally made with HTML only and later developed
      with CSS for exercise 7. In exercise 7, I created a CSS grid and organized the different sections. The project was relatively straightforward.
    The only issue I had was uploading the files so it would be accessible from any computer. To do this, I used github to push my files onto the
    portal page website.</p>

      <p>For my blog page, I wrote about type for mobile. I discussed the differenes in display between desktop computers and mobile
        devices and mobile input types. The blog page was designed to be mobile first. I struggled with the styling in the blog page.
         I had to look up which parts of the CSS correspond and color the different headers correctly. Next time, I need to seperate
       the normalize.css and the styles.css file. I ultimately learned a lot from this assignment through my many mistakes.
